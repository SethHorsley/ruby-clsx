# Clsx
## A gem for constructing HTML class strings conditionally

Ruby utility for constructing HTML class strings conditionally with the provided syntax, you can define a module named Clsx that includes a method to handle each case: strings, objects (hashes), arrays, and a combination of these with nested structures. This method will recursively process each argument, filter out falsy values, and concatenate the truthy values into a single string.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add "clsx"


## Usage
Strings (variadic)
```ruby
  clsx("foo", true && "bar", "baz")
  #=> "foo bar baz"
```

Objects
```ruby
  clsx({ foo:true, bar:false, baz:is_true? })
  #=> "foo baz"
```

Objects (variadic)
```ruby
  clsx({ foo:true }, { bar:false }, null, { "--foobar":"hello" })
  #=> "foo --foobar"
```

Arrays
```ruby
  clsx(["foo", 0, false, "bar"])
  #=> "foo bar"
```

Arrays (variadic)
```ruby
  clsx(["foo"], ["", 0, false, "bar"], [["baz", [["hello"], "there"]]])
  #=> "foo bar baz hello there"
```

Kitchen sink (with nesting)
```ruby
  clsx("foo", [1 && "bar", { baz:false, bat:null }, ["hello", ["world"]]], "cya")
  #=> "foo bar hello world cya"
```

You can also use clsx in rails views like this:
```ruby
  <div class="<%= clsx({ 'border': true, "border-t": false, "border-b":true }) %>">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
```
